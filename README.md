# hello-world
An old dogs journey to new tricks (and hopefully a few treats)

Greetings fellow organisms,

Alan here.  36 year old General Manager of a multi million dollar sushi restaurant.  Father of 2 and husband to the most beautiful woman in the world.  
Here is my journey in pivoting out of that space and into one of a developer.  I want to create and build and be there for my kids.  My dream is self teach myself into that existence.  Wish me luck!
